This folder contains annotations of the GSE data files.

These annotations were downloaded from the original publication that processed the > 6000 microarrays from Arabidopsis.

GSE69995_annotation.txt: this is the original annotation file.
GSE69995_annotation.xlsx: this is excel file which is easier to read by computer.
GSElistAnnotation.csv: this is a file generated by a automatic R script, in the scripts/util folder, you can find GeoQuery_ATHarray.R file which uses GEO query package to perform annotation. However this is not working perfectly, because some GSE series have sub-series that break the code.
