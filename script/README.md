FilterExprMat.R is a script that filter the input expression matrix. Only top 20% most variable genes will be included. The script will look up DAP-seq input files and list of known TF files to determine which transcription factors to be included in the final expression matrix

There will be two matrices for each experiment. *_TFlist.csv includes all names for transcription factors. *_ExpMat.csv includes all expression data.
